# Neural Network for Handwritten Digit Prediction

This project is a **Neural Network** built from scratch to predict handwritten digits. The network is implemented using just **Python** and **NumPy**, without any external machine learning libraries or frameworks. It can be trained using a simple script, and a web application is provided to allow you to test the network by drawing your own numbers.
**Project Overview**

This project is a simple neural network built for the task of digit classification. It is based on the well-known MNIST dataset, which consists of images of handwritten digits (0-9). The model is trained to recognize these digits and can predict the digit for unseen images.

Additionally, the model can also classify clothing items if opened with the code in the cloth folder, which was derived from the same code used for the number classification task. The clothing dataset is used to test the modelâ€™s ability to generalize.

**Important Notes:**

**Code Organization:**
The code for the neural network capable of understanding numbers is located in the number folder.
The code for the clothing dataset is located in the cloth folder. The cloth code is essentially a copy-paste of the number code and was used to test if the model's generalization ability was good for another task.

**Opening the Files:**
It is important that you open the number or cloth folder directly. Do not open the project with the main file (neural_network_) or the paths used in the code may become incorrect.

## Features

- **Training the Model**: You can train the model using the `learn.py` file in the `learning` folder. After training, you can run the `test.py` file to see the accuracy of the model on the test dataset.
- **Accuracy** :
The number classification model has an accuracy of 98.5%.
The clothing classification model has an accuracy of 90%.
- **Resetting the Model**: If you want to reset the model's knowledge, simply delete the `model.npz` file. This will remove the saved model, and you can retrain it from scratch.
- **Web Application**: The project includes a simple web app for testing the model by drawing numbers. To run it, go to `app.py`, run it, and visit the indicated link in the browser. Please note that predicting from the drawing feature is **still in beta** and has **low accuracy** at the moment.

## Installation

### Clone the Repository
To get started, clone the repository and navigate to the project folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MathewAlfrenn/Neural-Network.git
cd Neural-Network
```

**Setup Virtual Environment**
Create and activate a virtual environment (venv) for running the project:

python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

**On Windows:**
venv\Scripts\activate
**On macOS/Linux:**
source venv/bin/activate
**Install Requirements**
Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

**Training the Model**

To train the model, go to the learning folder and run the following script:
```bash
python learn.py
```
This will train the neural network and save the trained model to model.npz. After training, you can evaluate the accuracy by running:
```bash
python test.py
```
If you want to reset the model's knowledge, simply delete the model.npz file:
```bash
rm model.npz
```
**Running the Web Application**

To try out the web application and test the model with your own drawings:

Go to app.py.
Run the script:
```bash
python app.py
```
Open the indicated link in your browser (usually http://127.0.0.1:5000).
You can draw a digit on the canvas to see the model's prediction.
Note: The feature for predicting from drawings is still in beta and does not achieve high accuracy at this point.


**Technologies Used**
